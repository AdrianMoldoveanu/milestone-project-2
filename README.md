     ### Design 

       #### Colour Scheme
           
           - The two main colours used are white and blue to impact better with the background image.
       
       #### Typography

           - Vollkorn with fallback on Sans Serif is the main font used throughout the website. I find it both attractive and appropiate.
           - Graduate with fallback on Sans Serif is used for the results display, timer and progress.The numbers look like football scoreboard numbers and goes well with the theme.

       #### Imagery 

           - As a background image I choose a cartoon football pitch to describe that the quiz is about football but in his essence is still a game. For the image I choose clean pictures with enough resolution to not appear pixelated on any screen size.
